## Infrastructure

All servers are deployed on [Hetzner Cloud](https://hetzner.cloud/?ref=zcvAUvYIXilC)
(* ref link for â‚¬20 in credit). Big fan of Hetzner Cloud as they are both really
cheap compared to other mainstream providers like DigitalOcean / Linode /
Vulture / etc. and still have pretty good performance.
